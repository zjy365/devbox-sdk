# 0001-PRD-Sealos Devbox SDK with File Operations

## Introduction/Overview

This document defines the requirements for building a comprehensive Sealos Devbox SDK with advanced file operations capabilities. The SDK will enable developers, AI Agents, and third-party tools to programmatically manage Devbox instances and perform high-performance file operations, positioning Sealos Devbox as a competitive solution against platforms like E2B, Daytona, and CodeSandbox.

## Goals

1. **Provide a user-friendly SDK** for Devbox management with intuitive APIs for lifecycle operations
2. **Enable high-performance file operations** optimized for AI Agent workloads and code execution scenarios
3. **Support multiple programming languages** with priority on Python and TypeScript/Node.js
4. **Deliver competitive performance** matching or exceeding existing solutions (E2B, Daytona, CodeSandbox)
5. **Ensure robust security and reliability** with proper authentication, error handling, and monitoring

## User Stories

- As a developer, I want to create, delete, and manage directories in the workspace
- As a developer, I want to monitor file changes in real-time

**Devbox Management:**

- As a developer, I want to create new Devbox instances with specific runtime configurations
- As a developer, I want to start, pause, restart, and shutdown Devbox instances
- As a developer, I want to configure ports and environment variables
- As a developer, I want to monitor resource usage (CPU, memory) of my Devbox

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Core SDK Architecture

1.1. **Language Priority**: Initial release focuses on TypeScript/Node.js SDK with Python support planned for future releases
1.2. **Authentication**: Simple authentication using kubeconfig environment variable for API access
1.3. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with meaningful error messages
1.4. **Logging**: Built-in logging capabilities for debugging and monitoring
1.5. **Configuration**: Flexible configuration management for API endpoints and settings

### 2. Devbox Lifecycle Management

2.1. **Devbox Creation**:

- Create new Devbox instances with extensive runtime support (Node.js, Python, Go, Java, React, Next.js, Vue, etc.)
- Support for configuring CPU, memory, and storage resources
- Ability to set up ports with public/private access
- Environment variable configuration support
- Runtime templates from comprehensive library (40+ supported environments)

  2.2. **State Management**:

- Start, pause, restart, and shutdown Devbox instances
- Query current status and operational state
- Retrieve detailed configuration and connection information

  2.3. **Resource Monitoring**:

- Get CPU and memory usage metrics
- Retrieve historical monitoring data with time ranges
- Access pod status and health information

### 3. File Operations API

3.1. **Basic File Operations**:

- `write_file(path, content)`: Write text or binary content to a file
- `read_file(path)`: Read file content as text or binary data
- `delete(path)`: Delete files or directories
- `exists(path)`: Check if a file or directory exists
- `list_dir(path)`: List contents of a directory

  3.2. **Directory Operations**:

- `make_dir(path)`: Create directories with recursive support
- `remove_dir(path)`: Remove directories and their contents
- `copy_path(source, destination)`: Copy files or directories
- `move_path(source, destination)`: Move/rename files or directories

  3.3. **Batch Operations**:

- `upload_files(file_map)`: Upload multiple files efficiently using tar streaming
- `download_files(paths)`: Download multiple files as a compressed archive
- `sync_directory(local_path, remote_path)`: Synchronize entire directories

  3.4. **Large File Support**:

- `upload_large_file(path, on_progress)`: Upload large files up to 100MB with progress tracking
- `get_file_info(path)`: Retrieve file metadata (size, permissions, modification time)
- File size validation and error handling for oversized files

### 4. Performance Requirements

4.1. **Performance Target**: Small file operations under 50ms latency
4.2. **Small Files (<1MB)**: Use base64 encoding for minimal overhead
4.3. **Large Files (1MB - 100MB)**: Implement tar streaming with chunked transfer
4.4. **Batch Operations**: Automatic compression and optimized transfer protocols
4.5. **Concurrent Operations**: Support multiple simultaneous file operations
4.6. **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress reporting for large file transfers

### 5. API Integration

5.1. **RESTful API Integration**: Leverage existing Devbox REST API endpoints
5.2. **Authentication Integration**: Use kubeconfig environment variable for secure API access
5.3. **Rate Limiting**: Respect API rate limits and implement retry logic
5.4. **Timeout Management**: Configurable timeouts for different operation types

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **Direct Container Access**: The SDK will not provide direct container shell access or SSH capabilities
2. **Custom Runtime Creation**: Runtime environment management will be handled through existing Devbox APIs
3. **Database Operations**: No built-in database connection or query capabilities
4. **Web Interface**: The SDK will not include a web UI or dashboard components
5. **Cluster Management**: Operations on Kubernetes clusters directly (only through Devbox APIs)

## Design Considerations

### API Design Principles

- **Intuitive Interface**: Follow familiar patterns from Node.js `fs` module and Python `pathlib`
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with comprehensive type definitions
- **Async/Await**: All operations should be asynchronous with promise-based APIs
- **Error Consistency**: Standardized error types and handling patterns

### Performance Optimizations

- **Adaptive Transfer**: Automatically choose optimal transfer method based on file size
- **Compression**: Automatic compression for batch operations and text files
- **Caching**: Intelligent caching for frequently accessed metadata
- **Connection Pooling**: Reuse HTTP connections for multiple operations

### Security Considerations

- **Path Validation**: Prevent path traversal attacks with strict path validation
- **File Size Limits**: Configurable limits for file uploads and downloads
- **Permission Checks**: Validate user permissions for all Devbox operations
- **Secure Transmission**: All communications encrypted with HTTPS/TLS

## Technical Considerations

### Backend Implementation

- **Kubernetes Integration**: Leverage Kubernetes exec subresource for file operations
- **Tar Streaming**: Use tar with SPDY protocol for efficient batch transfers
- **Base64 Encoding**: Handle small files with base64 to avoid tar dependency
- **Resource Management**: Efficient memory usage for large file operations

### SDK Architecture

- **Modular Design**: Separate modules for Devbox management and file operations
- **Plugin Architecture**: Extensible design for future enhancements
- **Configuration Management**: Flexible configuration with environment variable support
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Comprehensive unit and integration test coverage

## Success Metrics

1. **Performance Metrics**:

   - File upload/download speeds comparable to or exceeding competitors (E2B, Daytona)
   - Latency under 50ms for small file operations
   - Throughput of at least 10MB/s for large file transfers
   - Support for 40+ runtime environments with superior performance

2. **Adoption Metrics**:

   - SDK downloads and installation numbers
   - Number of active projects using the SDK
   - Community contributions and engagement

3. **Quality Metrics**:

   - Test coverage >90%
   - API documentation completeness
   - Developer satisfaction scores
   - Bug report resolution time

4. **Reliability Metrics**:

   - Average response time <500ms

## Open Questions

1. **Concurrent Operations**: How many concurrent file operations should be supported per client?
2. **API Endpoint Configuration**: Should SDK support custom API endpoint configuration or use standard Sealos endpoints?
3. **Error Recovery**: What should be the default retry behavior for failed file operations?
4. **Runtime Validation**: Should SDK validate runtime availability before creating Devbox instances?
