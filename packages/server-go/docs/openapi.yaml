  title: DevBox SDK Server API
  description: |
    A comprehensive API for managing processes, sessions, files, and providing real-time monitoring capabilities.

    The DevBox SDK Server provides HTTP endpoints for:
    - **File Operations**: Read, write, delete, and list files with security constraints
    - **Process Management**: Execute processes synchronously or asynchronously with log monitoring
    - **Session Management**: Create and manage interactive shell sessions
    - **Real-time Communication**: WebSocket connections for live log streaming
    - **Health Monitoring**: Health check and readiness endpoints

    ## Authentication
    All API endpoints (except health checks) require Bearer token authentication:

    ```http
    Authorization: Bearer <your-token>
    ```

    ## Error Handling
    The API uses standard HTTP status codes and returns consistent error responses:

    ```json
    {
      "error": "Error description",
      "code": "ERROR_CODE",
      "timestamp": 1640995200000
    }
    ```

      summary: Write file (Smart Routing)
      description: |
        Write content to a file with smart routing based on Content-Type header.

        **Supported Modes:**

        1. **JSON Mode** (`Content-Type: application/json`):
           - Plain text content: Set `content` field with string data
           - Base64 encoded: Set `content` field with base64 data and `encoding: "base64"`
           - Path specified in request body

        2. **Binary Mode** (any other Content-Type except multipart/form-data):
           - Direct binary upload with zero encoding overhead
           - Path specified via query parameter, custom header, or base64-encoded query
           - Suitable for large files, images, videos, etc.

        3. **Multipart Mode** (`Content-Type: multipart/form-data`):
           - Standard FormData upload (browser-compatible)
           - File sent via `file` or `files` field
           - Optional `path` form field to specify target path
           - If no path provided, uses uploaded filename

        **Path Sources:**
        - JSON mode: `path` field in JSON body
        - Binary mode (priority order):
          1. Query parameter: `?path=/tmp/file.png`
        - Multipart mode: `path` form field or defaults to uploaded filename
