  title: DevBox SDK Server API
  description: |
    A comprehensive API for managing processes, sessions, files, and providing real-time monitoring capabilities.

    The DevBox SDK Server provides HTTP endpoints for:
    - **File Operations**: Read, write, delete, and list files with security constraints
    - **Process Management**: Execute processes synchronously or asynchronously with log monitoring
    - **Session Management**: Create and manage interactive shell sessions
    - **Real-time Communication**: WebSocket connections for live log streaming
    - **Health Monitoring**: Health check and readiness endpoints

    ## Authentication
    All API endpoints (except health checks) require Bearer token authentication:

    ```http
    Authorization: Bearer <your-token>
    ```

    ## Error Handling
    The API uses standard HTTP status codes and returns consistent error responses:

    ```json
    {
      "error": "Error description",
      "code": "ERROR_CODE",
      "timestamp": 1640995200000
    }
    ```
