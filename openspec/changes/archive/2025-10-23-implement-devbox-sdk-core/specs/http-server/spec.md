## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Bun HTTP Server Architecture
The system SHALL provide a Bun HTTP server that runs inside Devbox containers for file operations.

#### Scenario: HTTP Server Startup
- **WHEN** a Devbox container starts
- **THEN** the Bun HTTP server SHALL start on port 3000
- **AND** initialize file operation handlers
- **AND** begin accepting HTTP requests from the SDK

#### Scenario: Server Health Monitoring
- **WHEN** the SDK performs health checks
- **THEN** the HTTP server SHALL respond to GET /health
- **AND** return server status and readiness information
- **AND** include startup time and connection statistics

### Requirement: File Operation API Endpoints
The system SHALL provide HTTP endpoints for high-performance file operations using Bun native I/O.

#### Scenario: File Write Operations
- **WHEN** the SDK sends POST /files/write with file content
- **THEN** the server SHALL use Bun.write() for native file I/O
- **AND** validate file paths to prevent traversal attacks
- **AND** return success response with file metadata

#### Scenario: File Read Operations
- **WHEN** the SDK sends GET /files/read with file path
- **THEN** the server SHALL use Bun.file() for native file reading
- **AND** stream file content efficiently
- **AND** handle binary files and proper content types

#### Scenario: Batch File Operations
- **WHEN** the SDK sends POST /files/batch-upload with multiple files
- **THEN** the server SHALL process files sequentially or in parallel
- **AND** return individual operation results
- **AND** handle partial failures gracefully

### Requirement: WebSocket File Watching
The system SHALL provide WebSocket endpoints for real-time file change notifications.

#### Scenario: WebSocket Connection Establishment
- **WHEN** the SDK connects to ws://server:3000/ws
- **THEN** the server SHALL accept WebSocket connections
- **AND** register file watching subscriptions
- **AND** maintain connection health monitoring

#### Scenario: File Change Notifications
- **WHEN** files are modified in the container workspace
- **THEN** the server SHALL detect changes via chokidar
- **AND** send real-time notifications through WebSocket
- **AND** include file path, change type, and timestamp

### Requirement: Process Execution API
The system SHALL provide HTTP endpoints for command execution within Devbox containers.

#### Scenario: Command Execution
- **WHEN** the SDK sends POST /process/exec with command
- **THEN** the server SHALL execute the command in the container
- **AND** capture stdout, stderr, and exit code
- **AND** return execution results with timing information

#### Scenario: Process Status Monitoring
- **WHEN** the SDK requests process status via GET /process/status/:pid
- **THEN** the server SHALL return current process information
- **AND** include running time, resource usage, and state
- **AND** handle process termination gracefully

### Requirement: Security and Validation
The system SHALL implement security measures for all HTTP endpoints.

#### Scenario: Path Validation
- **WHEN** file operations request paths outside workspace
- **THEN** the server SHALL reject requests with traversal errors
- **AND** log security violations
- **AND** return appropriate HTTP error codes

#### Scenario: File Size Validation
- **WHEN** file uploads exceed configured limits
- **THEN** the server SHALL reject oversized files
- **AND** return descriptive error messages
- **AND** prevent resource exhaustion attacks
