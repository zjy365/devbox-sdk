# Implement Devbox SDK Core Architecture

## Why

Transform the current basic CLI scaffolding into a comprehensive TypeScript SDK for Sealos Devbox management, enabling AI agents, CI/CD platforms, and development tools to programmatically manage cloud development environments through high-performance HTTP API + Bun runtime architecture.

## What Changes

- **Add Core SDK Architecture**: Implement `DevboxSDK` class with modular, enterprise-grade design
- **Add API Integration**: kubeconfig-based authentication and Devbox REST API client
- **Add HTTP Connection Pool**: High-performance connection management with keep-alive and health monitoring
- **Add Bun HTTP Server Architecture**: Container-based HTTP server (port 3000) with native file I/O
- **Add File Operations API**: High-performance file read/write operations via HTTP endpoints
- **Add WebSocket Support**: Real-time file watching and change notifications
- **Remove CLI Functionality**: Convert from CLI tool to pure TypeScript SDK library

## Impact

- **Affected specs**: Creating new capabilities - `sdk-core`, `api-integration`, `http-server`, `connection-pool`
- **Affected code**: Replace current `src/main.ts` and `src/bin/cli.ts` with comprehensive SDK architecture
- **Breaking changes**: Current `add()` function and CLI will be removed and replaced with SDK classes
- **Dependencies**: Add HTTP client, WebSocket, and performance optimization libraries
