# connection-pool Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change implement-devbox-sdk-core. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: HTTP Connection Pool
The system SHALL maintain a pool of HTTP connections to Devbox HTTP servers for optimal performance.

#### Scenario: Connection Pool Initialization
- **WHEN** the SDK is initialized
- **THEN** it SHALL create an HTTP connection pool with configurable size
- **AND** implement connection reuse across multiple operations
- **AND** maintain connection health monitoring

#### Scenario: Connection Acquisition and Release
- **WHEN** an operation needs to communicate with a Devbox
- **THEN** the SDK SHALL acquire an available connection from the pool
- **AND** use it for the HTTP operation
- **AND** release the connection back to the pool after completion

### Requirement: Connection Health Monitoring
The system SHALL monitor the health of pooled connections and handle failures gracefully.

#### Scenario: Health Check Execution
- **WHEN** a connection is idle for the configured interval
- **THEN** the SDK SHALL perform a health check via HTTP GET /health
- **AND** mark unhealthy connections for removal
- **AND** automatically replace failed connections

#### Scenario: Connection Failure Recovery
- **WHEN** a connection fails during an operation
- **THEN** the SDK SHALL automatically retry with a new connection
- **AND** remove the failed connection from the pool
- **AND** create a replacement connection to maintain pool size

### Requirement: Keep-Alive and Performance Optimization
The system SHALL optimize connection performance through keep-alive and request batching.

#### Scenario: Keep-Alive Connection Management
- **WHEN** HTTP connections are established
- **THEN** they SHALL use keep-alive headers for connection reuse
- **AND** maintain connections across multiple requests
- **AND** achieve >98% connection reuse efficiency

#### Scenario: Concurrent Operation Support
- **WHEN** multiple file operations are requested simultaneously
- **THEN** the connection pool SHALL support concurrent operations
- **AND** limit concurrent connections to prevent resource exhaustion
- **AND** queue operations when pool capacity is reached
