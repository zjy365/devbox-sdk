# Ignore Configuration

devbox-docs: Documentation site, not published to npm

# Note on devbox-shared:
# - devbox-shared is an internal private package (private: true) and will not be published to npm
# - It cannot be in the ignore list because devbox-sdk depends on it (changesets validation rule)
# - It is linked with devbox-sdk to share version numbers
# - The private: true flag ensures it will never be published, even though it's not ignored
