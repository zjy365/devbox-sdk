# Devbox SDK Server API Documentation

Devbox SDK Server provides a comprehensive HTTP API for managing processes, sessions, files, and real-time monitoring capabilities.

## Overview

Devbox SDK Server is built with Go, follows RESTful principles, and supports real-time communication via WebSocket.

## Key Features

- **File Operations**: Complete CRUD operations with intelligent routing
  - JSON mode: For text and small files, with optional base64 encoding
  - Binary stream mode: For large files and media
  - Multipart FormData mode: For native browser uploads
  - Multiple upload methods: multipart, JSON, or direct binary
- **Process Management**: Execute processes synchronously or asynchronously with comprehensive log monitoring
- **Session Management**: Create and manage interactive shell sessions with environment and directory management
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSocket connections for real-time log streaming and event subscriptions
- **Health Monitoring**: Built-in health check and readiness endpoints for service monitoring
- **Security**: All sensitive operations require Bearer token authentication

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Bearer token for authentication
- HTTP client or API testing tool

### Basic Usage

**Note**: The default port is `:9757`, which can be changed via the `ADDR` environment variable or `-addr` flag.

1. **Health Check** (no authentication required):
   ```bash
   curl -X GET http://localhost:9757/health
   ```

2. **File Operations** (authentication required):
   ```bash
   # Write text file (JSON mode)
   curl -X POST http://localhost:9757/api/v1/files/write \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"path": "/tmp/hello.txt", "content": "Hello, World!"}'
   ```

3. **Process Management**:
   ```bash
   # Execute command asynchronously
   curl -X POST http://localhost:9757/api/v1/process/exec \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"command": "ls", "args": ["-la", "/tmp"]}'
   ```

## Authentication

All API endpoints (except health checks) require Bearer token authentication:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <your-token>
```

Include this header in all requests that require authentication.

## API Structure

The API is organized into several main categories:

- **Health**: `/health` - Service health check and readiness check
- **Files**: `/api/v1/files/*` - File operations and management
- **Processes**: `/api/v1/process/*` - Process execution and monitoring
- **Sessions**: `/api/v1/sessions/*` - Interactive session management
- **WebSocket**: `/ws` - Real-time log streaming and events

## Error Handling

The API uses standard HTTP status codes and returns consistent error responses:

```json
{
  "error": "Error description",
  "code": "ERROR_CODE",
  "timestamp": 1640995200000
}
```

Common HTTP status codes:
- `200` - Success
- `400` - Bad Request
- `401` - Unauthorized
- `404` - Not Found
- `409` - Conflict
- `500` - Internal Server Error
